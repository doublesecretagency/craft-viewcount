# How to decrement the counter

If necessary, it's possible to **reduce** the counter value by **decrementing** it. Decrementing a counter will subtract one from the current total.

The process of decrementing is nearly identical to the process of [incrementing a counter](/how-to-increment-the-counter/), except that the method is called `decrement` instead of `increment`.

:::warning Nearly Identical
Follow the docs for [incrementing a counter](/how-to-increment-the-counter/), swapping `increment` for `decrement`.
